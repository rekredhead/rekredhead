** Developer | Blockchain Enthusiast **
I am a freelancing full stack web developer. Currently I am in my 3rd Year in University and available for part-time work.
I am really into programming ( not with Java ) and learning about the Blockchain Space.
I am capable of building projects such as:
- Web Apps and Websites
- Automation Tools
- Web Scraping Tools
- Backend and Frontend Applications

# How I started programming
When I started coding, I used to build and program small robots using Arduino although, I saw it more as a hobby and didn't take it very seriously.
I used to build Obstacle Avoiding bots, a simple RC car, a mini piano using buttons, etc. to name a few. Since I was working with Arduino, I had to learn about C++ programming, which helped so much in understanding programming concepts as I grew up. I also learned about a few maths concepts like Matrices ( which I never want to look at again ). Building my own projects however the way I wanted, was the reason why I loved it so much.
Once I turned 17, I decided to focus more on coding and I moved towards Web Development and Blockchain Development, which is where I am currently at.
I realized that Embedded Systems programming was quite a tough field since you need to buy physical hardware and there were not many jobs involved with it (in my country), which is why I moved onto Web Dev.
Web Dev. was such a new field for me and I had no idea what was going on, I made so many mistakes when building projects. After a few months, I adapted to it well and even learned about backend development.
Making full stack apps such as a Student Management System and programs to automate my part-time work, gave SO much motivation to continue up this line.

# Why I am learning about Blockchain Development
I usually stay up-to-date on the latest crypto and blockchain news and interacting with a few blockchain devs. on LinkedIn.
When I learned more about the world's financial system and governance, I understood how flawed this system really is. Which is what inspired me to involve with Blockchain Development.
A Decentralized system where the community has control over the system rather than a specific group of people. A system with transparency, high-security, less governance and the users having ownership of their own data.
Seeing how the Blockchain system works, I really want it to succeed and fix the current financial system. Seeing how fast the community is growing and how important for this sort of system to be adopted, I too want to make it successful and be a part of it.

My Tech Stack:
- Frontend => React.js - Tailwindcss - Vite
- Backend => Node.js - MongoDB - Express.js
- Mobile Dev => React-Native - RealmDB
