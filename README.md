**`Developer | Blockchain Enthusiast`**

I am a freelancing full stack web developer. Currently I am in my 3rd Year in University and available for part-time work.
I am really into programming ( not with Java ) and learning about the Blockchain Space.
I am capable of building projects such as:
- Web Apps and Websites
- Automation Tools
- Web Scraping Tools
- Backend and Frontend Applications

<summary><h3>My Programming Journey </h3></summary>
<ul>
  <li>
    When I started coding, I used to build and program small robots using Arduino although, I saw it more as a hobby and didn't take it very seriously
  </li>
  <li>
    I used to build Obstacle Avoiding bots, a simple RC car, a mini piano using buttons, etc. to name a few. Since I was working with Arduino, I had to learn about C++ programming, which helped so much in understanding
    programming concepts as I grew up. I also learned about a few maths concepts like Matrices ( which I never want to look at again ). Building my own projects however the way I wanted, was the reason why I loved it so
    much
  </li>
  <li>
    Once I turned 17, I decided to focus more on coding and I moved towards Web Development and Blockchain Development, which is where I am currently at
  </li>
  <li>
    I realized that Embedded Systems programming was quite a tough field since you need to buy physical hardware and there were not many jobs involved with it (in my country), which is why I moved onto Web Dev
  </li>
  <li>
    Web Dev. was such a new field for me and I had no idea what was going on, I made so many mistakes when building projects. After a few months, I adapted to it well and even learned about backend development
  </li>
  <li>
    Making full stack apps such as a Student Management System and programs to automate my part-time work, gave SO much motivation to continue up this line
  </li>
</ul>

<summary><h3>My Interest in the Blockchain Space </h3></summary>
<ul>
  <li>
    I usually stay up-to-date on the latest crypto and blockchain news and interacting with a few blockchain devs. on LinkedIn
  </li>
  <li>
    When I learned more about the world's financial system and governance, I understood how flawed this system really is. Which is what inspired me to involve with Blockchain Development
  </li>
  <li>
    A Decentralized system where the community has control over the system rather than a specific group of people. A system with transparency, high-security, less governance and the users having ownership of their own data
  </li>
  <li>
    Seeing how the Blockchain system works, I really want it to succeed and fix the current financial system. Seeing how fast the community is growing and how important for this sort of system to be adopted, I too want to make it successful and be a part of it
  </li>
</ul>
